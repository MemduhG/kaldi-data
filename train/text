memduh_4 BORIS JOHNSON SAID HE DID NOT WANT AN ELECTION BUT PROGRESS WITH THE E U WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE IF THEY WON
memduh_5 TORY REBELS ARE JOINING FORCES WITH LABOUR TO BRING A BILL DESIGNED TO STOP THE U K LEAVING THE E U ON THIRTY ONE OCTOBER WITHOUT AN AGREEMENT
memduh_6 IT WOULD FORCE THE P M TO REQUEST A DELAY TO THIRTY ONE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY IN THAT EVENT
memduh_7 SPEAKING OUTSIDE NUMBER TEN EARLIER MR JOHNSON INSISTED THAT WITH M PS BACKING HE WOULD BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE CHANGES TO THE U K'S CURRENT BREXIT DEAL NEGOTIATED BY THERESA MAY AND REJECTED THREE TIMES IN THE COMMONS AT AN E U SUMMIT ON SEVENTEEN OCTOBER
memduh_8 BUT HE SAID IF M PS VOTED TO BLOCK NO DEAL THEY WOULD PLAINLY CHOP THE LEGS OUT FROM UNDER THE U K POSITION
memduh_9 THE P M SAID THERE WERE NO CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE PERSONALLY WOULD ASK BRUSSELS TO DELAY BREXIT AND U K NEGOTIATORS MUST BE ALLOWED TO GET ON WITH THEIR WORK WITHOUT INTERFERENCE FROM WESTMINSTER
memduh_10 LET US GET ON WITH THE PEOPLE'S AGENDA FIGHTING CRIME IMPROVING THE N H S BOOSTING SCHOOLS CUTTING THE COST OF LIVING AND UNLOCKING TALENT AND OPPORTUNITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE UNITED KINGDOM
memduh_11 FACED WITH MR JOHNSON'S PROMISE TO LEAVE THE E U ON THIRTY ONE OCTOBER WITH OR WITHOUT A DEAL A NUMBER OF M PS HAVE COME TOGETHER ACROSS PARTY LINES TO TRY TO PREVENT THE LATTER OUTCOME
memduh_12 THEY ARE EXPECTED TO PUT FORWARD LEGISLATION ON TUESDAY UNDER STANDING ORDER TWENTY FOUR A COMMONS RULE WHICH ALLOWS URGENT DEBATES TO BE CALLED
memduh_13 THE BILL WHICH HAS NOW BEEN PUBLISHED BY LABOUR M P HILARY BENN WOULD FORCE THE P M TO REQUEST A BREXIT DELAY TO THIRTY ONE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY UNLESS M PS HAD APPROVED A NEW DEAL OR VOTED IN FAVOUR OF A NO DEAL DEPARTURE BY NINETEEN OCTOBER
memduh_14 TORY REBELS WHO INCLUDE FORMER MINISTERS AND PROMINENT BACKBENCHERS HAVE BEEN WARNED THAT THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE LEGISLATION FACE BEING EXPELLED FROM THE PARTY AND DESELECTED
memduh_15 BUT LEADING FIGURES INCLUDING EX JUSTICE SECRETARY DAVID GAUKE HAVE INSISTED THAT DESPITE THE THREAT THEY WILL PRESS AHEAD AND IN THEIR WORDS PUT THE NATIONAL INTEREST AHEAD OF THEIR OWN
memduh_16 SPEAKING AT AN EVENT ON MONDAY EVENING LABOUR LEADER JEREMY CORBYN TOLD SUPPORTERS HIS PARTY WAS READY FOR A VOTE ADDING I WILL BE DELIGHTED WHEN THE ELECTION COMES
memduh_17 I'M READY FOR IT YOU'RE READY FOR IT WE'RE READY FOR IT
memduh_18 HE ACCUSED MR JOHNSON OF THREATENING PEOPLE WITH A NO DEAL BREXIT IF HE DOESN'T GET HIS WAY IN PARLIAMENT
memduh_19 DID BORIS JOHNSON JUST ANNOUNCE AN ELECTION WITHOUT ACTUALLY ANNOUNCING AN ELECTION?
memduh_20 HE'S ALWAYS SAID THAT HE REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO GO TO THE COUNTRY AGAIN
memduh_21 DOWNING STREET IS STILL ABSOLUTELY ADAMANT THAT IS STILL THE CASE AND AGAIN WITH THE FORMALITY OF THE NUMBER TEN PODIUM HE INSISTED IT WAS NOT WHAT HE WANTED TO DO
memduh_22 BUT HE ALSO MADE PLAIN THAT THERE WERE NO CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE WOULD ASK BRUSSELS TO DELAY OUR DEPARTURE FROM THE E U
memduh_23 AND THAT MEANS ONLY ONE THING 
memduh_24 CALLING AN ELECTION IF IN HIS VIEW HE NEEDS TO 
memduh_25 WHEN WOULD HE NEED TO DO THAT
memduh_26 SOON
memduh_27 THERE IS NOT DUE TO BE ANOTHER GENERAL ELECTION UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY TWO
memduh_28 UNDER THE FIXED TERMS PARLIAMENT ACT MR JOHNSON WOULD REQUIRE THE BACKING OF TWO THIRDS OF THE U K'S SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY M PS TO TRIGGER AN EARLY POLL THIS AUTUMN
memduh_29 SHOULD THIS HAPPEN THE PRIME MINISTER WOULD BE ABLE TO RECOMMEND THE DATE LIKELY TO BE A HUGELY CONTENTIOUS ISSUE GIVEN THE LOOMING BREXIT DEADLINE TO THE QUEEN
memduh_30 IF THERE IS AN ELECTION BEFORE THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN IT WOULD BE THE THIRD IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS AFTER POLLS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN
memduh_31 WHAT DOES THE NO DEAL BILL SAY
memduh_32 THE LEGISLATION TO BE PUT FORWARD ON TUESDAY SEEKS TO TIE BORIS JOHNSON'S HANDS AND INSTRUCTS HIM TO ASK THE E U FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE BREXIT PROCESS UNTIL THIRTY ONE JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY
memduh_33 A LOT OF ATTENTION WILL BE ON THE CLAUSE WHICH SAYS THAT IF THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL PROPOSES AN EXTENSION TO A DIFFERENT DATE THEN THE PRIME MINISTER MUST ACCEPT IT WITHIN TWO DAYS UNLESS THAT EXTENSION HAS BEEN REJECTED BY THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
memduh_34 IN OTHER WORDS THE POWER TO DECIDE WILL LIE WITH MEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT NOT WITH THE GOVERNMENT
memduh_35 FOR A P M WHO HAS PROMISED TO LEAVE ON THIRTY ONE OCTOBER COME WHAT MAY IT WOULD SEEM TO BE IMPOSSIBLE TO ACCEPT
memduh_36 HENCE ALL THE TALK OF AN EARLY ELECTION 
memduh_37 WE WILL KNOW FOR SURE BEFORE THE END OF THIS WEEK
