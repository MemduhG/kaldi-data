Brexit Election in October if M Ps block no deal
Boris Johnson I don't want an election you don't want an election
The government is expected to table a motion to hold a general election on fourteen October if it is defeated by M Ps opposed to a no deal Brexit on Tuesday
Boris Johnson said he did not want an election but progress with the E U would be impossible if they won
Tory rebels are joining forces with Labour to bring a bill designed to stop the U K leaving the E U on thirty one October without an agreement
It would force the P M to request a delay to thirty one January twenty twenty in that event
Speaking outside number ten earlier Mr Johnson insisted that with M Ps backing he would be able to achieve changes to the U K's current Brexit deal negotiated by Theresa May and rejected three times in the Commons at an E U summit on seventeen October
But he said if M Ps voted to block no deal they would plainly chop the legs out from under the U K position
The P M said there were no circumstances in which he personally would ask Brussels to delay Brexit and U K negotiators must be allowed to get on with their work without interference from Westminster
Let us get on with the people's agenda fighting crime improving the N H S boosting schools cutting the cost of living and unlocking talent and opportunity across the entire United Kingdom
Faced with Mr Johnson's promise to leave the E U on thirty one October with or without a deal a number of M Ps have come together across party lines to try to prevent the latter outcome
They are expected to put forward legislation on Tuesday under Standing Order twenty four a Commons rule which allows urgent debates to be called
The bill which has now been published by Labour M P Hilary Benn would force the P M to request a Brexit delay to thirty one January twenty twenty unless M Ps had approved a new deal or voted in favour of a no deal departure by nineteen October
Tory rebels who include former ministers and prominent backbenchers have been warned that those who support the legislation face being expelled from the party and deselected
But leading figures including ex Justice Secretary David Gauke have insisted that despite the threat they will press ahead and in their words put the national interest ahead of their own
Speaking at an event on Monday evening Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told supporters his party was ready for a vote adding I will be delighted when the election comes
I'm ready for it you're ready for it we're ready for it
He accused Mr Johnson of threatening people with a no deal Brexit if he doesn't get his way in Parliament
Did Boris Johnson just announce an election without actually announcing an election?
He's always said that he really doesn't want to go to the country again
Downing Street is still absolutely adamant that is still the case and again with the formality of the number ten podium he insisted it was not what he wanted to do
But he also made plain that there were no circumstances in which he would ask Brussels to delay our departure from the E U
And that means only one thing 
Calling an election if in his view he needs to 
When would he need to do that
Soon
There is not due to be another general election until twenty twenty two
Under the Fixed Terms Parliament Act Mr Johnson would require the backing of two thirds of the U K's six hundred and fifty M Ps to trigger an early poll this autumn
Should this happen the prime minister would be able to recommend the date likely to be a hugely contentious issue given the looming Brexit deadline to the Queen
If there is an election before the end of two thousand nineteen it would be the third in the past five years after polls in two thousand fifteen and two thousand seventeen
What does the no deal bill say
The legislation to be put forward on Tuesday seeks to tie Boris Johnson's hands and instructs him to ask the E U for an extension of the Brexit process until thirty one January twenty twenty
A lot of attention will be on the clause which says that if the European Council proposes an extension to a different date then the prime minister must accept it within two days unless that extension has been rejected by the House of Commons
In other words the power to decide will lie with members of Parliament not with the government
For a P M who has promised to leave on thirty one October come what may it would seem to be impossible to accept
Hence all the talk of an early election 
We will know for sure before the end of this week
Hurricane Dorian Bahamas sees unprecedented devastation
Hurricane Dorian appears to have cause unprecedented devastation in the Bahamas the country's leader says
The storm the second strongest Atlantic hurricane on record remains extremely dangerous said prime minister Hubert Minnis
Some thirteen thousand houses are feared damaged or destroyed according to the International Red Cross
Pictures showed surging floodwaters upturned cars and snapped trees
Eyewitness videos and reports paint a picture of massive and widespread flooding with panicked families fleeing to their roofs to escape rising floodwaters
One death has been reported
Dorian is the most powerful storm to hit the Bahamas since records began and will later move dangerously close to the U S east coast according to forecasters
It hit the Bahamas as a category five hurricane but has now weakened to a category four with maximum sustained winds near one hundred and fifty miles per hour 
Dorian will however remain a powerful hurricane during the next couple of days
The N H C said that only a slight deviation in the path of the storm could bring Dorian directly over Florida's east coast which is already expected to face life threatening storm surges and dangerous winds over the next couple of days
The U S states of Florida Georgia North and South Carolina have all declared states of emergency
What's the latest from the Bahamas
The storm is moving very slowly over Grand Bahama having earlier made landfall on the Abaco Islands which are just to the east
It has brought ferocious winds and massive amounts of water to both areas which are in the north of the Bahamas archipelago 
Grand Bahama with a population of about fifty thousand is only a hundred kilometers east of West Palm Beach in Florida
Forecasters had warned the storm could create life threatening storm surges as high as twenty three feet
Clint Watson a journalist based in the capital Nassau said people in Grand Bahama were being hit with buckets of rain and posting videos online showing water rising to the windows of their attics
You can't fathom that but that's what people are showing us with their videos saying Please come and rescue me 
I'm in the roof of my home and this is where the water is 
And you can see the water outside pressing in 
It's stories like that and images like that that you can't get out of your mind he told the B B C
Local media report that the international airport is under water
